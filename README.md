## CSST Exercise

Exercise - The exercises in the CSST 104 subject were demonstrated by our professor during our laboratory sessions. These exercises served as examples for our future activities, and everything demonstrated can be used in our system code for our Thesis Topic.

## CSST Activity

Activity - In addition to the demonstrations by our professor during CSST 104 laboratory sessions, we also engaged in activities that required independent work. These sessions provided us with the opportunity to apply the concepts learned during the demonstrations and build upon them. By creating our own foundations based on what we learned during the demonstration period, we strengthened our understanding and proficiency in the subject matter.

## CSST Task

Task - For our midterm exam in CSST 104, we were assigned a task by our professor that required us to solve a problem based on the concepts demonstrated during our laboratory sessions. This task was completed at home, and our professor provided a deadline for its submission. It focused on the topics covered during our practical sessions, emphasizing our understanding and application of the demonstrated material.
